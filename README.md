# Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Survey Form

----
## Objective
Build a [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io/) app that is functionally similar to
[this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP). Fulfill the below user
stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.

----
## Rules
You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is
recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and you should
get some practice with plain CSS. You can use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose.
Additional technologies (just for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are
not recommended for this project, and using them is at your own risk.

## User stories
- [x] I can see a title with ```id="title"``` in ```H1``` sized text.
- [x] I can see a short explanation with ```id="description"``` in ```P``` sized
 text.
- [x] I can see a ```form``` with ```id="survey-form"```.
- [x] Inside the ```form``` element, I am required to enter my name in a field
with ```id="name"```.
- [x] Inside the form element, I am required to enter an email in a field with
```id="email"```.
- [x] If I enter an email that is not formatted correctly, I will see an
```HTML5``` validation error.
- [x] Inside the ```form```, I can enter a number in a field with
```id="number"```.
- [x] If I enter non-numbers in the number input, I will see an ```HTML5```
validation error.
- [x] If I enter numbers outside the range of the number input, which are
defined by the min and max attributes, I will see an ```HTML5``` validation
error.
- [x] For the name, email, and number input fields inside the form I can see
corresponding labels that describe the purpose of each field with the following
ids: ```id="name-label"```, ```id="email-label```, and ```id="number-label"```.
- [x] For the name, email, and number input fields, I can see ```placeholder```
text that gives me a description or instructions for each field.
- [x] Inside the form element, I can select an option from a dropdown that has a
 corresponding id="dropdown".
- [x] Inside the form element, I can select a field from one or more groups of
radio buttons. Each group should be grouped using the name attribute.
- [x] Inside the form element, I can select several fields from a series of
checkboxes, each of which must have a value attribute.
- [x] Inside the form element, I am presented with a textarea at the end for
additional comments.
- [x] Inside the form element, I am presented with a button with id="submit" to
submit all my inputs.
